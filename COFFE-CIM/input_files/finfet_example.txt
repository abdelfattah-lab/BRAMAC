# EXAMPLE COFFE INPUT FILE (FINFET TRANSISTORS)
#
# Note: COFFE interprets any line beginning with a '#' as a comment in it's input files.
#
# COFFE input parameters can be divided into 2 groups:
# 1- Parameters describing the FPGA architecture
# 2- Process technology-related parameters

##### Architecture Parameters
#######################################

# The following parameters are the classic VPR architecture parameters
N=10
K=6
W=320
L=4
I=40
Fs=3
Fcin=0.2
Fcout=0.025

# The following architecture parameters are new and help COFFE describe
# a more flexible BLE. See [1] for more details.

# Number of BLE outputs to general routing 
Or=2

# Number of BLE outputs to local routing
Ofb=1

# Population of local routing MUXes 
Fclocal=0.5

# Register select:
# Defines whether the FF can accept it's input directly from a BLE input or not.
# To turn register-select off, Rsel=z
# To turn register select on, Rsel=<ble_input_name>
# where <ble_input_name> = the name of the BLE input from which the FF can
# accept its input (e.g. a, b, c, etc...).
Rsel=c

# Register feedback muxes:
# Defines which LUT inputs support register feedback.
# Set Rfb to a string of LUT input names.
# For example: 
# Rfb=c tells COFFE to place a register feedback mux on LUT input C.
# Rfb=cd tells COFFE to place a register feedback mux on both LUT inputs C and D.
# Rfb=z tells COFFE that no LUT input should have register feedback muxes.
Rfb=c

##### Process Technology Parameters
#######################################

# Transistor type can be 'bulk' or 'finfet'. 
# Make sure your spice model file matches the transistor type you choose.
transistor_type=finfet

# The switch type can be 'pass_transistor' or 'transmission_gate'.
switch_type=pass_transistor

# Supply voltage
vdd=0.9

# SRAM Vdd
vsram=1.1

# SRAM Vss
vsram_n=0.0

# Gate length (nm)
gate_length=20

# This parameter controls the gate length of PMOS level-restorers. For example, setting this paramater 
# to 4 sets the gate length to 4x the value of 'gate_legnth'. Increasing the gate length weakens the 
# PMOS level-restorer, which is sometimes necessary to ensure proper switching.
rest_length_factor = 1

# For FinFETs, minimum transistor refers to the contact width of a single-fin transistor (nm). 
# COFFE uses this when it calculates source/drain parasitic capacitances.
min_tran_width = 47

# Length of diffusion for a single-finger transistor (nm).
# COFFE uses this when it calculates source/drain parasitic capacitances.
trans_diffusion_length = 47

# Minimum-width transistor area (nm^2)
min_width_tran_area = 13277

# SRAM area (in number of minimum width transistor areas)
sram_cell_area = 4

# Path to SPICE device models file and library to use
model_path=spice_models/ptm_20nm_finfet_hp.l
model_library=20NM_FINFET_HP

##### Metal data
##### R in ohms/nm
##### C in fF/nm
##### format: metal=R,C
##### ex: metal=0.054825,0.000175
#######################################

# Each 'metal' statement defines a new metal layer. 
# COFFE uses two metal layers by default. The first metal layer is where COFFE 
# implements all wires except for the general routing wires. They are implemented
# in the second metal layer. 

# All wires except the general routing wires are implemented in this layer.
metal=0.054825,0.000175

# General routing wires will be implemented in this layer 
metal=0.007862,0.000215

# If you wanted to, you could define more metal layers by adding more 'metal'
# statements but, by default, COFFE would not use them because it only uses 2 layers.
# The functionality of being able to add any number of metal layers is here to allow
# you to investigate the use of more than 2 metal layers if you wanted to. However,
# making use of more metal layers would require changes to the COFFE source code.
