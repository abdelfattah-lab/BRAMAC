'''
This is the top-level tester for COFFE runs.
To add a test, you need to provide 1) a reference file 2) an input file 3) an acceptable margin for error.
As features are added to COFFE, you should ensure they are covered by the tests in this file. 
As COFFE invokes HSPICE many times and hence has a high runtime, we are also trying to cover COFFE's features with a small
number of architectures by changing many architecture parameters from one test to the next.
The following are some examples for these items.
